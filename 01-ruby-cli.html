<h1>Writing your first Ruby CLI application</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Congratulations on taking your first steps toward learning ruby! 
In this tutorial we'll cover: </p>

<ul>
	<li>Creating a Ruby program and running it in Terminal</li>
	<li>Making that program run in Terminal no matter what directory you're in</li>
	<li>Reading from and writing to files in Ruby</li>
</ul>

<h2>Getting Started</h2>

<h3>Hello World</h3>

<p>First we'll cover the basics of creating and running a program in Ruby.
 One popular way of showing basic program structure for someone learning a
 new language is to show them a Hello World program. 
 Hello World is a program that outputs the line of text "Hello World" to
 the console. 
 Sounds simple, doesnt it? It is! </p>

 <p>In Ruby, "Hello World" looks something like this: </p>

 <pre>
 puts "Hello World"
 </pre>

 <p>Pretty straightforward, right? Here <code>puts</code> is a Ruby command
 that tells your program to write the statement that follows to the Terminal
 window.</p>

 <p>Go ahead and type or cut-and-paste that line of code into your text editor and 
 save it. 
 Call it <code>hw.rb</code></p>

 <h3>Running your first Ruby program</h3>

 <p>Now that you have written your first program, let's learn how to run it and see 
 what happens.
 In the terminal type <code>ruby hw.rb</code> and press enter. You should see the
 words "Hello World" appear on the next line of the terminal. </p>

 <p>Congratulations! You just wrote and ran your first Ruby program</p>

 <h2>Next steps in Ruby</h2>

 <h3>Variables</h3>
 
 <p>In much the same way you learned in Algebra class how to use letters like "x" and "y" as placeholders for numbers in mathematical operations, Ruby lets us define variables to use as placeholders in our <em>code</em>. The biggest difference is that, with Ruby, variables can hold amost <em>any kind</em> of information.</p>

 <h3>Data Types and Operations</h3>

 <p>What is a, "kind of information?" Take a second to think about it. It might help to ask yourself: </p> 

 <ul>
 <li>What do all words have in common?</li>
 <li>All numbers?</li>
 <li>What is the difference between a number and a word?</li>
 </ul>

 <p>Don't worry. These are things we grow up having an innate sense for, so it can be hard to quickly come up with an explanation. There is probably more to it, but the important takeaways for <em>our</em> purposes are: </p>

<ol>
<li>Every kind of information or, "Data Type" in programmer-speak has a value</li>
<li>A Data Type has a set of actions or, "Operations" help us do things we normally need to do to manipulate that value</li>
</ol>
